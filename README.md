# HDCShare Project Demo

### Summary

This is a demo of a file-transfer software I build for Home Detective Co. in North Carolina. The project was built in one month with a strict deadline to be ready for a company-wide employee training. The main pillars the project needed to exhibit were useability and security.

### Post-Launch feedback

More info to come as the demo is finished! The employee training will take place on 10/20/2023. Wish me luck!
